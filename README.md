# AnimatedButton

Welcome to the Animated Button App, a demonstration of how to use SwiftUI to create a simple yet dynamic button 
that responds to user interactions.

In this app, you will see an example of a button that shows the buttons that fly out when pressed. 
The code for this animation is written in SwiftUI, Apple's modern UI framework, which allows for easy and efficient 
creation of dynamic user interfaces.

Whether you are a beginner or experienced developer, this app serves as a great example of how to implement simple 
animations in SwiftUI. Feel free to download the code and use it as a starting point for your own SwiftUI projects.
